**profile README** is a feature provided by GitHub, with which a README.md from a repository with the same name as your profile can be rendered on top of your profile page.

Here are some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or useful in your profile README:
- An "About me" section that describes your work and interests
- Contributions you're proud of, and context about those contributions
- Guidance for getting help in communities where you're involved

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your profile README by using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). For a hands-on guide to customizing your profile README, see "[Quickstart for writing on GitHub: Learn advanced formatting features by creating a README for your GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)."
